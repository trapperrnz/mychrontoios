Python [AiM](https://www.aim-sportline.com) XRK file reader.

Once upon a time, AiM released a DLL to read their proprietary data file format
and provided some sample code for import into Matlab. That article can be found
[here](https://www.aim-sportline.com/download/software/doc/how-to-access-xrk-files-data-without-aim-software_101.pdf)

I don't use Matlab, but I can do stuff with Python, so here we are. This
repository contains a Python wrapper for the AiM provided DLL + a Conversion to be able to run on an IOS App .
